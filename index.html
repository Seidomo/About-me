                 Hy my name is Seid and i was born and raised in Ethiopia in East Africa,
                 i came to the States in 2013 and first moved to Seattle since the first
                 day i fell in love with Seattle and promised not to move anywhere so am 
                 and still here. I have been as a sales person in a small 99 cent store for 
                 first two years the started driving Uber, after been driving for like a years
                 i got my CDL and started driving semi truck which is an interesting and challenging
                 because you are litteraly everywhere spending a lot of nights on the road. 
                 After my first baby boy was born i started working only local loads and i was not 
                 on the road no more i was just delivering conatiners from the port of Seattle 
                 to the nearby wearhouses. 
                 My aim is to become a software developer.
